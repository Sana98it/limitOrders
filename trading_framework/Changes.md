Some Changes which can we handy to resolve these issues.

Error Handling: The framework's protocols for executing buy/sell orders throw generic ExecutionExceptions, but they could provide more detailed errors (e.g., insufficient funds, network issues) to allow for better error handling.

Asynchronous Operations: In a real-world trading environment, order execution and market data updates are asynchronous. The current design doesn't explicitly support asynchronous operations, which might limit the system's ability to operate efficiently in live markets.

Scalability: The simple loop through all orders on each price tick may not scale well as the number of orders grows. In a high-frequency trading scenario, this could lead to delays in order execution.

Order Management: The system lacks functionality for order modification or cancellation, which are critical in real trading environments. Traders often need to adjust their orders in response to market movements.

Market Data Handling: The system processes only price updates. In reality, a trading system might need to handle various types of market data (e.g., bid/ask prices, volume) for more sophisticated trading strategies.

Security and Authentication: There's no mention of security or authentication mechanisms for the
